ext-src-path
============

An extension to point to the source location of Google Chrome extentions

Description from the Webstore (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extension-source-locator/cmhbfegjgncgaikpopenldnaidbhdopp): Would you like to see how popular extensions have implemented a feature? Tired of looking for the extension ID to construct the path that will lead you to the source?

^^The problem with the extension interface is that the extension takes over the new tab functionality, After installing the extension the new tab will show the installed extension names and a button to view their source. THis is annoying to most users. The other thing is that source code of only the installed extensions can be seen which is possible with other extensions**

This is the extension for you!

Features:
Replaces the functionality of the New Tab
Lists all installed extensions with their icons next to it
Allows to copy to the clipboard the extension path
